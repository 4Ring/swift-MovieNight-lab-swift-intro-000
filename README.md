> All that is gold does not glitter,  
Not all those who wander are lost;  
The old that is strong does not wither,  
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.  
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,  
A light from the shadows shall spring;  
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,  
The crownless again shall be king -[Bilbo Baggins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_that_is_gold_does_not_glitter)

You made it to the final project! 

This iOS app is titled Movie Search. When a user opens the app, they're presented with a screen that will allow them to search for a movie. The search will display the poster images of those films on a screen where the user can then scroll through the search results. When a poster image is tapped, it will bring up a detailed view which displays information about the film.
